# Pottersay

When bored, all of us have typed [_cowsay_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) and [_fortune_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) into our terminals. `cowsay` and `fortune` are the linux command-line tools inspired our project. Our project outputs a random Harry Potter quote along with a beautiful Harry Potter themed ASC-II art.
